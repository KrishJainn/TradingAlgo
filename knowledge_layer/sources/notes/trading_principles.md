# Core Trading Principles

## Position Sizing

Position sizing is the most critical aspect of risk management. Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on any single trade. In volatile markets, reduce position sizes further.

### Kelly Criterion
The Kelly Criterion helps determine optimal position size:
- f* = (bp - q) / b
- Where b = odds, p = win probability, q = loss probability

### Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing
Adjust position sizes based on ATR (Average True Range):
- Higher ATR = smaller position size
- Lower ATR = larger position size allowed
- Target consistent dollar risk across all positions

## Entry and Exit Strategy

### Entry Timing
- Wait for confirmation before entering
- Multiple indicators confirming increases probability
- Avoid chasing - let price come to you
- Entry threshold should be higher in volatile markets

### Exit Strategy
- Define exit before entering the trade
- Use trailing stops in trending markets
- Fixed stops in ranging markets
- Exit on signal deterioration, don't wait for stop

## Market Regimes

### Trending Markets
- Momentum strategies work best
- Use trend-following indicators (ADX, moving averages)
- Wider stops, let winners run
- Aggressive players can increase position sizes

### Ranging Markets
- Mean reversion strategies work better
- Use oscillators (RSI, Stochastic)
- Tighter profit targets
- Conservative approach recommended

### High Volatility
- Reduce position sizes by 30-50%
- Wider stops to avoid noise
- Focus on quality setups only
- Volume breakout strategies can work well
